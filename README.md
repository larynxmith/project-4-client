# Approach
My initial approach was to get the MERN authorization in place, so a user could be manipulated. After that, it was all about creating an items list that could be modified and manipluated.


# Installation Instructions

# Descriptions of any Unsolved Problems or Major Hurdles 
The project acutally progressed fairly nicely; no hurdles were too major, thankfully. I didn't realoze until the day before I had forgotten(ha!) to link my users and items, but that was a quick fix. Material-UI is always a good time, and it definitely slowed me down in certain stylings, but it is always worth the effort. Ultimately, the deployment got in the way of my final styling, so it's a bit MERN-Auth-alicious. 

I would have liked to have implementented a push notification system for items coming/already due, but I wanted to stay in scope, and I had concerns getting that up and running in the time allotted. Stretch goal for refactoring.
